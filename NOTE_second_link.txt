We are sorry for the mistake.
The second link for the checkpoints of ICDAR 2015 gets an unexpected letter ‘V’ at the end.

So the right link is
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mbTj6vCK7BhmyTmuc1EfPFijamFpLbWs
rather than
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mbTj6vCK7BhmyTmuc1EfPFijamFpLbWsV

We are very sorry for this.
